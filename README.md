# Bank Churn Analysis Project

Customer churn is a very common problem in financial institute whenever banks and other financial institutes wants to  prevent losing active customers. A good prediction model can save a bank millions of dollars annually to retain the customers and growth.


## Project Goals

This Project has three main objectives. 

Perform a statistical analysis to determine why some groups of customers have a higher churn rate than others. 

Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using storytelling and visualisation. 

Machine learning algorithms can be implemented to forecast the likelihood of client attrition.
